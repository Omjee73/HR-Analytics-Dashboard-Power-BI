# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI
## Project Overview:
This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, aimed at uncovering workforce patterns, salary distributions, and attrition trends. The dashboard empowers HR teams to make data-driven decisions by identifying high-risk areas, salary imbalances, and workforce demographics.

## Dataset:
File: HR_Analytics.xlsx
Description: Contains anonymized employee information including: Department, Education Field, Age, Salary Slab (categorized), Gender, Attrition status

## Tools and Techniques:

1. Power BI (Dashboard Creation, Advanced Visuals, DAX Measures)

2. Data Transformation (Power Query Editor)

3. Dynamic Filters (Slicers: Gender, Department, Attrition, Salary Slab)

##Visual Types: Clustered Bar Charts, Line Chart, Decomposition Tree, KPI Cards, Donut Charts

## Key Visualizations:

1. Employees by Salary Slab and Attrition

2. Employees by Department

3. Attrition Count by Age

4. Employees by Gender Distribution

5. Attrition Analysis Across Departments

6. Decomposition Tree for Attrition Root Cause Analysis

7. KPI Card showing Average Tenure at Company

## Key Insights:

1. Majority of employees are concentrated in the upto 5k salary slab.

2. Research and Development department has the highest number of employees.

3. Sales department shows a higher attrition rate compared to others.

4. Employees aged 25–35 years exhibit the highest attrition.

5. Gender distribution shows a male-dominated workforce.

6. The average employee tenure at the company is approximately 4.33 years.

## Recommendations:

1. Launch focused retention strategies for the Sales department.

2. Review compensation plans for lower salary slabs to improve retention.

3. 4. Develop career growth and mentoring programs for employees in the early career phase (ages 25–35).

Promote gender diversity through inclusive hiring initiatives.
